1. **(Inertia)**
	An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at a constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force
2.**(Force)**
	The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the force applied
	$$F=ma$$
3. **(Action and Reaction)**
	Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first
