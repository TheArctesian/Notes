We for loop through each element of the array inside we preform another for loop checking if the next element is larger, if it is swap it, if it isn't go on to the next element. After looping through all the elements the array will be sorted

## 3
- (a)
	An algorithm used to organize data in an in array in a certain order
- (b)
	Bubble sort checks each elements relationship, while selection sort checks for the the min value for each section and swaps those variables 

## 6
While looping through each element. A min element is defined and set to the first number, if a number is found that is smaller then that it swaps. This process repeats swapping larger values for smaller values till the array is fully sorted 

THIS IS SHIT

## 9
As binary sort runs in fasted if the data is sorted as it runes it O(log(n)) time while linear runs in O(n) time.

Section B 

## 10 
- (a) 
1. They are both double for loops 
2. They both swap elements 
3. Selection sort only swaps min and max values where bubble sort swaps every time there is a bigger number
4. Selection sort runs in
