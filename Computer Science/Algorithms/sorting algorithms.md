For IB we need to know to 

## Bubble Sort 
works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

in java that would look like 

```java

```

It operates in O(n)^2 time complexity 
## Selection Sort 
The **selection sort algorithm** sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. 

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

-   The subarray which already sorted. 
-   The remaining subarray was unsorted.

In every iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
