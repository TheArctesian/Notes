-   **Up (horizontal axis)**: Fictional or fantastic things, virtue, happiness, life and health, high status, power
-   **Down (horizontal axis)**: Reality or real things, depravity, sadness, death and sickness, low status, powerlessness
-   **Left (vertical axis)**: That which is known or given
-   **Right (vertical axis)**: That which is unknown or new
