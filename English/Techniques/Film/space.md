This refers to the empty portions of an image. Space is used to draw attention to the objects that are in the image.

For example, an image with lots of space can convey isolation or emptiness while images with little space can convey chaos and intense activity.

Australian painter Jeffery Smart was renowned for his use of space to convey the emptiness and loneliness of urban life.
