The way a character looks with their eyes and face. Gaze is a useful way to convey meaning through an image because we can see where and how a figure is looking at something.

-   -   **Intra-diegetic**: The character is looking at something within the text
    -   **Extra-diegetic**: The character is looking at something outside of the text. In some instances, the subject may be looking directly at the viewer. This is called a **demand** **gaze** or **direct gaze**.
