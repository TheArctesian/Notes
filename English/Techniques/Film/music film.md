When students come across a piece of music in a film, the first step they usually take is to categorise it as either **diegetic** or **non-diegetic**.

-   **Diegetic music** is music that exists in the world of the movie. For example, if a song is playing through a character’s earbuds, or radio, in a film, that music is likely diegetic.
-   **Non-diegetic** music is the opposite; music that does not exist in the world of the film. This is music that only the audience can hear. This distinction is useful to keep in mind, as the effects of diegetic and non-diegetic music may be different.
