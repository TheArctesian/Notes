In editing, wipes are used to transition between scenes in a variety of ways rather than just cutting. Types of wipes include:

-   **Horizontal wipe** – the wipe moves horizontally across the screen
-   **Vertical wipe** – The wipe moves vertically across the screen
-   **Diagonal wipe** – The wipe moves diagonally across the screen
-   **Star wipe** – The wipe is the shape of an expanding star to demonstrate something special happening
-   **Heart Wipe** – The wipe takes the shape of a heart expanding or contracting to illustrate romance or friendship
-   **Clock Wipe** – The wipe is a circular motion like a clock arm to illustrate the passage of time
-   **Matrix wipe** – a patterned transition between scenes
