In black & white images examine the use of contrast, light and darkness. In a colour image, colours are used to signify feelings and evoke a response. For example:

-   Red = passion, anger, hell, vitality, etc.
-   blue = peace, harmony or coldness.

Hue, Tone, Shade, and Tints are other ways of referring to colours. Specifically:

-   **Hue** refers to the actual **colour**. For example, red, green, blue, etc.
-   **Tone** refers to the intensity of the colour. For example, you can adjust the **hue** by adding black and white to it to change its warmth or coolness.
-   **Shades** are when you only add black to the **hue**, making it darker.
-   **Tints** are where you only add white to a **hue**, making it lighter.
