The sound of a film helps to create atmosphere – this can include:

-   **Sound effects**
-   **Dialogue**
- [[music]]
-   **Silences**
-   **Voice-overs**

Like music, sound can be divided into:

-   **Diegetic**_:_ occurring in the world of the film
-   **Extra-diegetic** (occurring outside the world of the film)
