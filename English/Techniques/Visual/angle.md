refer to the tilt of the camera in relation to the scene and the characters. Unusual camera angles can emphasise an action sequence, disorientate the audience, and suggest the relationship between characters.

The main angles are:

-   **Low** – Establishes the power of the character or object
-   **Eye-Level** – Allows the audience to get personal with the character(s)
-   **High** – Presents the subject as vulnerable or lacking in power
-   **Worm’s Eye** – Presents the figure as very large and/or powerful
-   **Canted** (also known as a **Dutch Angle**)- Develops psychological unease or tension.
-   **Bird’s Eye** – Often used to establish a shot and characters’ relationship to it
