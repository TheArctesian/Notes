Layering images/scenes to have a dramatic impact.
In Act 3, Scene 4 of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the eponymous Prince holds up images of his father and uncle to illustrate Hamlet’s feelings about their differences through juxtaposition:

“Look here upon this picture and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow?
…Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear
Blasting his wholesome brother.”(3.4.54-67
