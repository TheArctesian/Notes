A rhetorical technique where a character speaks to an object, quality, or idea, or discusses somebody who is absent or dead.

In ‘The Sunne Rising” by John Donne, the speaker refers to,

“Busy old fool, unruly Sun,  
Why dost thou thus,  
Through windows, and through curtains, call on  
us?  
Must to thy motions lovers’ seasons run?  
Saucy pedantic wretch …”

Here, the speaker takes a casual (colloquial) register and mocking tone to chide the sun for interrupting him and his lover in bed.
