Human characteristics given to a non-human object. Inanimate objects take on a life.

Personification is usually well-understood by students. It is a specific kind of metaphor in which human attributes are applied to nonhumans. Note that unlike pathetic fallacy, personification involves the application of any form of an attribute, not just emotions. Like other forms of metaphor, it is widely used in literature, as well as daily life.

In John Donne’s ‘Death, be Not Proud,’ Donne personifies Death.
