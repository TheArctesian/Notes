This is a term usually used to describe modern texts that are constructed from pre-existing material, often belonging to multiple sources and text types.

Alain De Botton’s _Art of Travel_ can be broadly considered a bricolage text. This pluralistic method of representation, which reflects de Botton’s postmodernist context, suggests that there are multiple, equally valuable versions of reality – those found in art and those that we experience individually.
