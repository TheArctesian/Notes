First, second or third person.

-   **First person** refers to the speaker himself or a group that includes the speaker (i.e., I, me, we and us). T.S. Eliot’s ‘Journey of the Magi’ is a first person narrative.
-   **Second person** refers to the speaker’s audience (i.e., you). Italo Calvino’s _If On A Winter’s Night A Traveller_ is a narrative in the second person.
-   **Third person** refers to everybody else (e.g., he, him, she, her, it, they, them), including all other nouns (e.g. James, Swedish, fish, mice).  Jane Austen’s Emma is written in the third person.

Some texts might shift between different perspectives throughout. T.S. Eliot’s ‘Preludes’ is relatively unusual in that it switches between first, second, and third person throughout.
