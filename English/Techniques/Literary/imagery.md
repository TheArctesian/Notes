Imagery is language that evokes one of the five senses, and you must always refer to the specific kind. In other words, never use simply ‘imagery,’ but always ‘olfactory imagery,’ ‘tactile imagery,’ ‘visual imagery,’ ‘auditory imagery’ or ‘gustatory imagery.’ Occasionally, students, noticing that ‘visual imagery’ is something of a tautology, omit the adjective ‘visual’ when referring to this category. They shouldn’t, though. Always be specific.
