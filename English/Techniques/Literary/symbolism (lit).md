[When an object represents one or more (often complex) ideas](https://www.matrix.edu.au/literary-techniques-symbolism/). Symbolism is a very important technique, and in some texts, it is the central technique. A symbol is any visual object that by convention signifies something else, whether it be another object, an idea, a process, or an emotion. The letters of the alphabet are therefore symbols, in that they represent speech sounds. Numbers are symbols.

Although all language is symbolic, literary symbolism usually refers more specifically to the use of objects to represent ideas and emotions. The Eliot poems set for study in Module B are all heavily symbolic. Consider the following example, from the opening of Eliot’s ‘The Hollow Men’:  
’We are the hollow men  
We are the stuffed men  
Leaning together  
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!  
Our dried voices, when  
We whisper together  
Are quiet and meaningless  
As wind in dry grass  
Or rats’ feet over broken glass  
In our dry cellar.”

A first step in interpreting the symbolism is to think about the ideas the objects conventionally imply. ‘Hollow’ and ‘dried’ and ‘dry’ all evoke aridity. This suggests the poem might be concerned with decline and decay. Eliot was influenced by Frazer’s [_Golden Bough_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Bough), which he cited in the notes to his most famous poem, The Waste Land. (A reader wanting to push her analysis further would look into how the symbols evoking aridity reflect Frazer’s theory that a number of important religions, including Christianity, had their origins in prehistoric fertility cults.)
