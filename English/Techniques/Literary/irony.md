Gap between what is said and what is meant.

1.  The use of words to express something different from and often opposite to their literal meaning.
2.  An expression or utterance marked by a deliberate contrast between apparent and intended meaning.
3.  Incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs.

For example In Fitzgerald’sThe Great Gatsby, Nick Carraway’s assertion that, “I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores,” is ironic because he is not, in fact, reserving judgement on those he calls “veteran bores.”
