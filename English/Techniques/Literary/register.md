This refers to the level of sophistication of a piece of language. We expect a high register in formal contexts, while we might expect lower registers in more familiar contexts. High register is signalled by conceptual, ‘bigger’ vocabulary and complex, lengthy syntax. The common registers we refer to are: slang, colloquial, informal or formal. Consider the following greetings:

-   Slang: Hey, how youse goin, cuz’?
-   Colloquial: G’day, how ya going, mate?
-   Informal: How’re you doing?
-   Formal: Hello, how are you today, Ms?
