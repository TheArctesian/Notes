Repetition of consonants throughout a sentence or phrase.

For example, John Keat’s “Ode to a Nightingale” employs half-rhyming consonance in the first stanza. We can see this in the first two lines:

“My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains  
My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,”

There is consonance in the “n” sounds in the first line and the “k” sounds in the second.
