Sequential – in chronological order.

In a linear narrative, authors simply tell the reader what happens in their story chronologically.

The linear narrative of a bank robbery might begin with the bandits approaching in their car and move through all the noteworthy incidents until their inevitable capture and arrest.

While it begins **in media res**, Shakespeare’s _The Tempest_ is a linear narrative.

The non-linear version might begin in media res during a shootout, and move backwards to explain how the robbers arrived in their predicament, before moving forward to the resolution of the story. Margaret Atwood’s _Hagseed_ is a non-linear text.
