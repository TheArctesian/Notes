Forceful use of the verb at the start of sentence or phrase. The imperative mood is one of the grammatical moods in English. Other moods include the indicative (as in ‘That cat is suspicious’) and the interrogative (‘Is that cat suspicious?’). The imperative mood is useful to refer to since it’s the mood for commands (e.g. ‘Go to bed!’ ‘Shut the door!). If a speaker uses the imperative, then he or she may be an authority figure.

Before the third section of Orwell’s _Nineteen Eighty-Four_, Winston and Julia are caught. A man named Mr. Charrington, whom Winston had believed was a gentle shopkeeper, turns out to be a member of the secret police. Mr. Charrington’s authority in the secret police is indicated by his use of the imperative to command another officer when he first enters the room.
