Syntax is one of the main components of language. It refers to the organisation of words and phrases in a sentence, as well as their structural relations.

For example, in the English sentence ‘John thanked the president,’ we know that John is the one doing the thanking since English syntax usually follows a subject, verb, object order. ‘John’ is the subject, ‘thanked’ is the verb, and ‘the president’ is the object.

If I swap the roles, the nouns of English syntax change the meaning of the sentence: ‘The president thanked John.’Therefore, when referring to syntax as a technique, you need to provide further analysis. Some strategies you can take to assess this are:

-   **Complex syntax** is a marker of a high education. This could imply a narrative voice that is well-educated.
-   **Simple syntax** might be a marker of poor education, as might fragmented or incomplete syntax.
