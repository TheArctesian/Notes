Reference is a very broad term. It simply means mentioning, usually clearly and unambiguously, something else, whether it is a historical event, another author, another text, or even a set of ideas.

‘No! I am not Prince Hamlet’ is a reference to Shakespeare’s _Hamlet_ in his T.S. Eliot’s poem, ‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.’
