Alliteration means the repetition of sounds at the start of a word in two or more words in close proximity. Alliteration is a real technique used in [[poetry]], and, in some traditions, it is a unifying feature of the verse. 

For the most part, you should be **careful** identifying alliteration. It’s seldom used in prose, and when it is used in poetry, it often does not have a specific meaning, being rather a convention of the genre. Use with caution!

The opening line of William Blake’s ‘The Tyger’ provides an example of alliteration: ‘Tyger, tyger, _b_urning _b_right,’ and this technique is used throughout the poem.
