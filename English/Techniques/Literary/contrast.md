[Contrast is the deliberate positioning of two or more objects/events/characters who have different characteristics](https://www.matrix.edu.au/literary-techniques-contrast/). This is often done to accentuate their unique individual qualities.

[[Paradox]], [[antithesis]], [[oxymoron]], [[juxtaposition]], contrast in description are all techniques that employ contrast.

For example, In Shakespeare’s Henry IV, Pt 1, there is a consistent contrasting occurring between Henry, the title character, who is old and stern; his young son, Hal, or is wild, unpredictable and intelligent; and, the quick-tempered and stubborn Hotspur, Hal’s rival for the throne. Shakespeare contrasts these figures to discuss the ideal qualities of a king.

These techniques all use contrast, but they are much more specific:

-  [[juxtaposition]]: Placing two things side-by-side to reveal a contrast.
-   Oxymoron: Two contradictory words are written or said side-by-side. eg. bitter sweet
-   Paradox: A statement that contradicts itself.
-   Antithesis: Two oppositional ideas or concepts that are put together.
