A poetic form that uses repetition, rhythm, and/or rhyme to convey a sense of magic or magical power.

The song of the Weird Sisters, or Three Witches, in Shakespeare’s Macbeth (1606) is a good example of an incantation:

Double, double toil and trouble;  
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.  
Cool it with a baboon’s blood,  
Then the charm is firm and good. (4.1.36-40)
