An interesting or unique personal story or account. Composer’s use of anecdotes in both fiction and non-fiction texts to develop their ideas, demonstrate elements of a character’s personality, or add to their world.

In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Professor Dumbledore offers the following anecdote about his brother:

“My own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practising inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I’m not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery….” (_Goblet of Fire_, P. 454)

This anecdote is a clue to eagle-eyed readers that Aberforth, Dumbledore’s brother, is the barman of the Hog’s Head Tavern and the reason why Dumbledore knows so much about what happens there.
