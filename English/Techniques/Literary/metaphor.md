Comparison of 2 objects where one becomes another – adds further layers of meaning about the object being compared.
Metaphor is one of the most fundamental figures of speech, and indeed aspects of language itself. Literary texts are typically dense in metaphor. In the cases of writers such as Shakespeare, it is impossible to understand the text without constantly unpacking metaphors.

In Shakespeare’s Henry IV, Pt 1, Sir John Fallstaff puns on the homonyms “son” and “sun” to develop the metaphor of Prince Hal as the Sun, the ruler of the heavens:

“If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? . . . Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses?” (2.4.359-67)
