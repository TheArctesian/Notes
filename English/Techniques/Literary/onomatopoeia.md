A word that echoes the sound it represents. The reader hears what is happening.

Sometimes this can be overt, as in “the drip-dripping and plip-plopping of a tap.”

Other times, this can be more subtle, such as in “The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eve” from John Keats’ ‘Ode to a Nightingale.” This example is specifically known as mechanical onomatopoeia because the sound of the word imitates the same sound being referenced – “murmurous” sounds like the low buzz of a swarm of flies.
