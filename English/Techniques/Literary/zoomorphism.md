The attribution of animal properties to non-animals. This technique is more common than many people expect.

It is used, for example, in Eliot’s ‘Prufrock’:  
“The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,  
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,  
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,  
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,  
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,  
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,  
And seeing that it was a soft October night,  
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.”

The fog appears to be compared with a dog, which is suggested by the actions of the fog and the diction throughout, such as the word ‘muzzle.’ This somewhat uncanny image is difficult to interpret, but at the least relates to the disorientation caused to the speaker by the urban environment.
