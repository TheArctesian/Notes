### Articles

Articles are the words that we place before a noun to denote whether it is a specific or generic object. In English, we have two types of article:

1.  **Definite** article – The
2.  **Indefinite article** – A or an

We use the **definite article** to refer to a specific object. Using a definite article tells the reader which object it is.

The **indefinite article** refers to a general or non-specific object.

_Can I ride the bicycle?_ This refers to a specific bicycle and suggests the speaker is wanting to ride a particular bike.

_Can I ride a bicycle?_ This can refer to any bicycle and can mean that the speaker is asking if they can ride any bicycle, or they may be questioning if they are allowed or able to ride a bike.

Some nouns do not take articles, they are known as **non-countable nouns** or **mass nouns** (in Australia we tend to refer to these as mass nouns). Mass nouns are things which cannot be divided up into parts or represent non-concrete or abstract things:

A good rule of thumb is to think if you are talking about general or broad things. You can’t refer to all things with a specific word – “The.”

In addition, names don’t take articles (but there are some exceptions, such as referring to cars: “I’ll take the Porsche for a spin”). So, the following categories of words won’t take an article:

-   Companies or entities
-   Holidays
-   Geography
    -   places, locations, streets
    -   continents, countries, cities, single lakes, single mountains, single lakes, states, towns (note that rivers do take a definite article.)
-   Languages
-   Sports

Finally, to make things more confusing, there are quite a few words that are both mass and count nouns. For example:

-   Wine: Wine is an alcoholic beverage (mass noun). He wanted a glass of wine (count noun).
-   Hair: I like my hair (mass noun). I found a couple of hairs in my salad (count noun).

If you are unsure of whether a word is a count or mass noun, look up its definition in a reputable dictionary like the Collins, Macquarie, Oxford, or Cambridge dictionaries.
