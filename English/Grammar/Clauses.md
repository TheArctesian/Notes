Clauses are units of grammar that sit below the sentence in terms of organisation. Sentences are made up of several different clauses.

Below is a word tree illustrating the different parts of a sentence:

A typical clause is made up of a subject noun and a **predicate**. A **predicate** is the part of a clause that includes a verb and information relating to the subject noun.
There are different types of clauses:

-   **Independent clauses**: A clause that can stand on its own and contains a **subject** and **predicate**.  
    _Good students punctuate_ (good students = subject; punctuate = verb)
-   **Dependent clauses**: A clause that provides essential information about the sentence, but cannot stand on its own.They must attach to an independent clause to make sense.  
    _because good students punctuate_* (“because” = subordinate conjunction; “good students” = subject; “punctuate” = verb)
-   **Relative clauses**: Relative clauses define or identify the nouns, noun clauses, and noun phrases that precede them. They must attach to an independent clause to make sense.  
    _whom the teacher tormented.*_ (“whom” = relative pronoun or adverb; “the teacher” = subject; “tormented” = verb)
-   **Noun clause**: A clause that functions as a noun. They must attach to an independent clause to make sense.  
    _The good students knew the rules that govern commas._ (“The good students” = subject; “knew”= verb; “the rules that govern commas” = noun clause)
