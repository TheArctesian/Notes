Plural agreement occurs when the number of the noun, be it singular or plural, matches the number of the verb.

For example, “_we are running_” combines a plural noun, “_we_”, with a plural verb phrase “_are running_”.

It would be wrong for us to say, “_I are running_”* or “_we is running_.”*

A good test is to ask yourself if the verb is in the plural form and if the noun numbers more than one. If they don’t match appropriately, rewrite the sentence so that they do.
