The subject of a sentence is the main, or initial noun. A subject noun on its own is the smallest possible sentence.

_Dog._

A predicate is the part of a sentence that tells us something about the subject (its state, what it’s doing, etc).

_The dog barks__._  (verb only predicate)

_The dog was blue._ (verb-adjective predicate)

_The blue dog ate food._ (verb-direct-object predicate)

_The blue dog barked at the thief._ (verb-prepositional-object predicate)
