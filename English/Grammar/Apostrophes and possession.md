An apostrophe – **‘** – is a punctuation mark that indicates either possession or if the word is a [[contraction]] of two words

We use an apostrophe to denote whether a noun possesses something, be it an object or quality. When we want to denote possession, we place an apostrophe before an “_s_” and after the noun – **‘s**

Let’s look at how possessive apostrophes are used on singular [[nouns]]:

_The cat’s collar._

_The child’s choice._

_A mother’s bravery._

_Judy’s sword._

_Samuel’s pen._

Possessive apostrophes are also used on plural nouns ending in **-s**. Rather than it preceding the noun, the convention in Australian written English is to place the apostrophe after the “s”:

_The ants’ nest_

_The parliamentarians’ constituents_

_The state’s libraries’ book collections_

_The teachers’ rules._

_The boys’ toy._

Using possessive apostrophes correctly is an integral part of clear English communication.

Apostrophes for contractions don’t follow a consistent rule. They can be used to shorten a singular word or combine two words:

Cannot ⇒ Can’t

Do not ⇒ Don’t
