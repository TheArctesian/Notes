Colons are used to present a list.

_In his pockets, John had: a pen, a pencil, a rubber, five dollars in change, and a small poodle._ 

Colons can also be used to replace a [[Semi-colon]] if there is a very strong relationship between the independent clauses.

_I don’t like running: it gives me sore feet._
