The most common rule is for listing. When listing a series of three or more things, phrases, or clauses we separate them with commas. For example,

_Mary wrote using full-stops, semi-colons, colons, exclamation marks, and commas._

We use commas to show relations between [[clauses]]:
- independent clauses
	Use commas to separate independent clauses that are separated by these seven coordinating conjunctions: and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet.
	_Because the sentence was incomplete, she added an independent clause._

-  subordinate clauses
	_The sentence, which lacked punctuation, lost the student marks._
	_The student worked hard. In their case, however, it wasn’t enough._

Use a comma near the end of a sentence to separate coordinating ideas or to indicate a pause or shift.

_She was ungrammatical, not lazy._

Use a comma to shift between the main statement and a quotation (known as a speech tag).

_The teacher said, ‘You must use commas!’_
