Verbs are the action words in a sentence that describe what the subject is doing. Along with nouns, verbs are the main part of a sentence or phrase, telling a story about what is taking place. In fact, without a verb, full thoughts canâ€™t be properly conveyed, and even the simplest sentences, such as _Maria **sings**_**,** have one. Actually, a verb can be a sentence by itself, with the subject, in most case you, implied, such as, **_Sing_**! and **_Drive_**!

1.  Mark **eats** his dinner quickly.
2.  We **went** to the market.
3.  You **write** neatly in your notebook.
4.  They **thought** about all the prizes in the competition.
