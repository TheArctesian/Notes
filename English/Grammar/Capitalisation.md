Capitalisation – the use of an upper case letter to begin a word – indicates whether a word is a **proper noun** or the start of a sentence (or both).

Capitalisation is very important as it allows us to understand what sort of objects or things the words represent.

When we start a new sentence, we capitalise the first word to indicate the first word of a sentence. This is especially useful when we start a new paragraph.

However, proper nouns are used to indicate an individual person, place, institution.

Proper nouns do not take articles except in specific circumstances.
