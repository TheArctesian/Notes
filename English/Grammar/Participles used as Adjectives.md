Sometimes we want to describe a noun by an action it is doing or has been subject to. This allows us to be specific about the nouns we are discussing. When we do this, we use participles to describe the noun:

_John’s failed exam paper was on top of the pile._

or

_Judy’s amazing exam paper was in the teacher’s hand._
