Participles are words that are formed out of verbs and then used in a similar manner to an adjective or nouns, or as part of a verb phrase.

Participles are used to describe nouns, noun phrases, verbs, and verb phrases.

There are two sorts of participles:

1.  Present participle: Adjectives ending in -ing
2.  Past participle: Adjectives ending in -ed, or the form of an irregular verb (for example,Â _rung_)
