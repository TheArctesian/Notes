An adverb is a word that modifies (describes) a verb (he sings loudly), an adjective (very tall), another adverb (ended too quickly), or even a whole sentence (Fortunately, I had brought an umbrella). Adverbs often end in -ly, but some (such as fast) look exactly the same as their adjective counterparts.

Tom Longboat did not run **badly**.

Tom is **very** tall.

The race finished **too** quickly.

**Fortunately,** Lucy recorded Tom’s win.

It’s easy to identify adverbs in these sentences.
