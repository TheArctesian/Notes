There are five **major moods** and several **minor moods**.

The **major moods** are:

-   **Conditional mood:** This is used to make requests
-   **Indicative mood:** We use this when we make factual statements and uses high modality
-   **Imperative mood:** This used to make commands
-   **Interrogative mood:** This is used to ask questions
-   **Subjunctive mood:** This is used to convey wishes or possibilities

The **minor moods** are:

-   **Tag moods:** Sentences, questions, or declarations added to a declarative sentence
-   **Pseudo-imperative:** A command that presents a choice, and so isn’t a full command
-   **Alternative question:** This is a particular type of question where the participant is offered a pair of choices. (_“Do you want to pass your assessment or fail it?”_)
-   **Exclamative:** As the name suggests, this is a mood signalled by a shout or excited expression. (_“I love cheese!”_)
-   **Optative:** This a mood used to express optimism, desire, or hope about something. (_“I hope Blood Command tour Australia this year.” “My marks can only improve.”_)
-   **One more sentence:** A sentence requesting “one more” of something. (_“One more question and I’ll leave you alone, Sir.”_)
-   **Curse:** An insult or an utterance wishing bad luck or ill health. (_“You’re a cad!” “I hope you get boils!”_)
