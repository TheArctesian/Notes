Contractions are words where two words have been shortened into one. We mark contractions by using an [[apostrophe]]

Most contractions combine a pronoun with a form of the verbs “To be” – _am, are, is –_ “To have” – _have, has, had_ – and the auxiliary verb “will’.

Some examples are:

-   I am = I’m
-   We have = We’ve
-   You have not= You’ve not or You haven’t
-   Who is = Who’s
-   Should have = Should’ve

When writing formally, you should not use contractions.
