Conjunctions are words that connect clauses together, co-ordinate clause, or introduce clauses.

There are three types of conjunction:

-   **Coordinating conjunction:** This is a conjunction that joins different clauses together
-   **Subordinating conjunctions:** A subordinating conjunction joins a dependent and independent clause
-   **Correlative conjunctions:** These are pairs of conjunctions that join clauses, words, or phrases that have a complementary or reciprocal relationship.
