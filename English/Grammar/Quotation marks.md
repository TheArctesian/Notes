Quotation marks come in two varieties (single —**‘  ‘** — and double —**” “**). Quotation marks are used to signify dialogue or cited text.

We have two types of quotation mark so we can differentiate between citation and cited dialogue or referred speech.

_“My favourite song off Pagan’s new album is ‘Silver’.”_

_“I heard John say to Judy, ‘I desperately need your economic notes.’ But she refused to share them.”_

_“Shakespeare’s ‘Sonnet 151’ should be taught with caution.”_

-   Question marks:
    -   If the dialogue contains a question, the question mark lies inside the quotation marks. _“Do you want a coffee?”_
    -   If the dialogue is reported as part of a question, the question mark falls outside of the quotation marks. _“Did you say, “I want a coffee’?”_
-   Maintain the grammar of the sentence:
    -   When you include a quotation in your sentence, you need to adjust the punctuation (commas, colons, period, dashes) to maintain the grammar of the sentence.
    -   If you need to signify a speech tag, the comma falls inside the quotation marks. _‘”Klaus, come here,” said Judy.’_ 
    -   When referring speech or a citation that includes a question mark or exclamation mark and the dialogue ends the sentence, use the included punctuation. _“Judy said, ‘Come here, Klaus!'”_
    -   If it ends with a speech tag, finish the sentence with a period, or if appropriate, a question mark or exclamation mark. _‘”Come here, Klaus!” said Judy’_
