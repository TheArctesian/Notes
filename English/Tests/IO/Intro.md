This commentary will focus of the impact of culturedon migrant families.This will analysed through 2 texts. The first being Unaccustomed Earth, a collection of short stories written by bengali-american author 	Jhumpa Lahiri. The second 'Manari' a 2020 film written and directed by korean-american autour [[Lee Isaac Chung]]. 

The first extract is from the page 44 of the short story titled hell heaven in unaccustomed earth. 

This passage demonstrates how Lahari uses characterisation to present how different forms of acculturation lead to conflict within families. The two characters that best exemplify this are usha and her mother. In line 5 Lahari paints the begalis as 'clusterd together at last' the use of visual imagery and the emphatic resoulation when escaping the host culture introduces first genertion imgrants method of acculatioan, sepration. Them being able to 'speak freely after the focred chitchat with the americans', examplfies the complete rejection of american culture, in contrast Usha after changing into 'jeans thick sweater and some sneakers' annonces that she ' felt finnaly like myself'. With the change in clothing manifesting itself as a visual metaphor for acceptance of host culture. Lahari further demonstrates her embrace of american culture by using cliches such as teanagers smoking weed together and walking on the beach with dogs present in much of adolcent amercian media. 

The juxtaposition of the freedom felt by the bengalis when away from the culture and the freedom Usha feels when she is engrossed in the host culture present a recurring theme throughout lahris work of conflict between first and second generation in the degree of acculturation and acceptance of host culture.
