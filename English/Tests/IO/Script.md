This commentary will focus of the global issue of the migrantion on the culture and identity. More specifically how the methods of [[Acculturation]], assimilation, integration, and separation affect migrant families. 

This will analysed through 2 texts. The first being Unaccustomed Earth, a collection of short stories written by bengali-american author Jhumpa Lahiri. The second 'Manari' a 2020 film written and directed by korean-american autour [[Lee Isaac Chung]]. 

<hr>
The first extract is from the page 44 of the short story titled hell heaven in unaccustomed earth. 

The extract demonstrates how lahari uses chareriszation to present how diffrent forms of acculturation lead to conflict within familes and idvidual identities, more specifily how the methods of acculatraion differ in 1st generation and 2nd generation migrants.

The first character we will be looking at is the main character's mother, representing sepration.

In line 5 Lahari paints the Usha mother and the rest of the bengalis as 'clusted together', this visual imagery create a tense mood and intorduces the sepration of the migrant and local cultures this, emphised on line 6 where the bengalis could 'at last speak freely after the forced chitchiat with the americans'. The diction implys the feeling of resoultion on escaping the host culture as well as infering the stress caused by the imposing culture forces. This demonstrating the method of acculturation separation as lahari shows the complete rejection host culture customs and adhereing to their pre defined identiy

The second character we will look at is usha, who represents the 2nd generations teenage on the road to assimilation. In contrast to the freedom Ushas mother experienced on line 6 in line 11  Usha changes into 'jeans, thick sweater and some sneakers'  The change in clothing from traditional Saree dress to cliché america clothes manifest as a visual metaphor for stripping  away native culture and embracement of host culture, this is point is further supported in the line 16 when ' felt finnaly like herself'., demonstrating the freedom of cultural acceptance and how her idenitiy as a bengali is overuled by the host cultuer. 

This is not without conflict however as her mothers "silent fury" line 9, the irony of describing fury as silent portrays the unspoken conflict between first and second generation migrants. Combined with constant "states" line 17, creates and uneasy uncomfortable tone. 

The juxtaposition of the freedom felt by the bengalis when away from the culture and the liberation Usha feels when engrossed in the it present a recurring theme throughout lahris work of conflict between first and second generation in the degree of acculturation and acceptance of host culture.

The conflict of identity caused by the methods of acculturation in migrant families are continued throughout the collection. A particularly prevalent example is the character of Kaushik. 

Throughout part 2 of the collection, Kaushik rejects bengali culture outraged at the conservative subservience of his fathers new wife commnenting 'it makes me wish i wasn't hindu'. aditianoly it and outburst screaming "Your mother is nothing in comparsion. Just as servant to wash my fathers clothes and cook his meals". This aggresive dialouge reinforces the them of assmilation in second generation migrants. 

Additionally when living with a Bengali family Kaushik is described as "living antipodal lives under the same roof". The geographical metaphor exemplifies the juxtaposition of Kaushik's assimilated cultural identity with the begnali's native culture. 

While first generation migrants connected because as commented in once in a lifetime 'you mother and mine were both equally alone'.  Demonstrating that 1st gen imagrants feel strong opposing cultral forces, enforcing sepration. 

The second genration however is potrayed as embracing the loneliness of individualism and structing their identity and culture to be the antithesis of their bengali roots. Often this has negative affects for the character such as Rahul in the story years end who grows depressed and alcholic when entering univesity, showing how the overflow of impeding cultral forces can result in confusian in identity. His begali parents however did not beileve depression was are desies and thus the cultral clashes cause Rahul to further his disent into debauchery. 

In conclusion lahrai presnets 1st generation and second generation imagrants as oppsoites one being seprated from the host culter and adhereing to the bengali identity and the 2nd gen rejecting their bengali identity and fully embracing the host cultral norms. Showing the often negative affects clashing methods of accultruation have on family dynamics and lifestyle of migrants.

As opposed to the sepration and assimilation as the methods of acculturation in Unucostmed Earth. Manari focuses focus heavily on the passage from sepration to integration. 

One character the exemplifies this conflict is Jacob. In the beginning of the film we see jacob rejecting the advice of the deviner saying "Don't beilieve in the nosense korean people think with their heads". This arrogance towards american cultral norms presents a degree of separation between host and native culture, maintaing korean customs and identity instead of asssimlating to the host cultre. 

Their local culture and heritage is as well planted in the ground with their grandmother soon-ja who brings with her native korean culture,

In the extract from 145th minute or miniari, the zenith of the film culminates in an both literal and metaphorical explosion or the Yi family. 

In 1i we can see how Lachlan Milne the cinematographer, carefully positions the house in the left 2 coloms of the frame. Utilising the compositinal axis to represent what is known, a recurring visual device used throughout the movie. The bright tones and orange hues, resulting from Lee Issac Chungs choice of using real fire instead of CG fire can be interpreted as a visual metaphore represting the death of their kown methods of farming. Killing off the arrogance in culture held by jacob in his methods of cultivation. 

In 3i and 4i we see another great use of the horizontal composition axis.  3i shows a picture of the Yi's first weding photo postino on the left showing the known, and the jump cut to the right in 4i is pricture of the unkown showing photos of their family in the farm. 

The impact of the integration to the host culture is seen in the music used in this seen. Throught the movie the composer Emile Mosseri use the bb minor scale. In the seen we begin with the arpegiated bb chord follwing the chord 1-5-4 chord porgession in the minor scale soncily examplfies saddness of the situation, being the death of the Yi's family livlehood. However as the scene progresses Mosseri switches the tonal center to the relative major along with scenes or integration, adhereing to the deviners and pauls advice. Finally reaching a apex at the point where they harvest the manari. This shift of tonal centers and scales potrays the shift from sepration to integration as a positive thing opposing lahari's views on the matter where accultration causes conflict, showing how a familia unit following the same method of accultration can lead to a better life for all.

The overall lessons that these two texts teach us about the global issue is that separation is natural in the process of acculturation, however a persistance on separation will often lead to both internal and external conflicts. In general the authors present the most vital aspect of adapting to a new culture is to do so as a familial unit, and to confront chalenges in unciné.
