### Aim
Understand the affects HM's surgery had 

### Method
[[Longitudinal Study]] [[Case Study]] using [[Method triangulation]]

### Background 
After a head injury when he was 7, HM suffered from epileptic seizures. To solve this he had an experimental surgery in which the surgeon removed parts of his medial temporal lobe on both sides of his brain. HM the suffered from both anterograde and retrograde amnesia.

### Procedure 
Miller preformed test including
- [[Psychometric Testing]]
- [[Direct Observation]]
- [[Interviews]]
- [[Cognitive Testing]]
- [[MRI]]

### Results 
HM could not acquire new episodic memory (memory of events) or semantic memory (general knowledge of the world), suggesting areas associated with short and long term memory ([[Memory Models]]) were damaged.

HM showed capacity for working memory given the he was able to have a regular conversation. 

HM was able to remember the floor plan of his house demonstrating the spacial memory is not associated with episodic or semantic memory.

HM retained procedural memory and could new procedures given training

HM's hippocampus was damaged

### Finding 
The hippocampus plays a critical role in transferring semantic and episodic memory from short term to long term memory

Different types of memory are associated with different parts of the brain

Short term memory is not stored in the hippocampus

### Evaluation 
| Benefits | Limitations | 
|--| --|
| Longitudinal | Not replaceable  | 
| Method Triangulation | Retrospective | 
| High ecological validity  |  |
