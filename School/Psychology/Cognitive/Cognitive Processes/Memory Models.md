### Working Memory Model
The working Memory model suggests that memory is encoded into different stores. When receiving sensory input, with attention, the information is proccsed by the central executive, passing it into a slave system
- Visiospatial sketchpad (Visual and space)
- Phonological Loop (inner voice)
- Episodic buffer (RAM)

Through rehearsal it can be processed to LTM and retrieved to their representative stores
