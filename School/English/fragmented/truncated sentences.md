Incomplete sentences used to increase tension or urgency, or reflect the way people speak to each other. Sentence fragments are sentences that cannot stand on their own. A single noun is a sentence fragment, as is a subordinate clause, such as ‘That he knew better.’ If you’re trying to identify a sentence fragment, just ask yourself whether it could stand on its own, or whether it needs some other element to complete it. In the previous example, we could add ‘I said that he knew better.’ Sentence fragments can convey many things.

T.S. Eliot used fragmentation in tandem with symbolism to explore non-mimetic forms of expression, for example in ‘The Hollow Men’. Fragmentation will usually convey notions of destruction and decay, so when interpreting instances of it think about what sorts of themes your author is exploring.
