Ellipsis is sometimes used to [[truncate]] quotations that are long by using three consecutive periods (…).

In literature,  Ellipsis can be employed in a variety of different ways. Most commonly, a dramatic pause is signalled by (…) creates tension or suggests words can’t be spoken. For example, if a character were to suggest doubt about what another has just said they might respond with, “…Sure…,” where the pauses convey the speaker’s scepticism. In _To The Lighthouse_, Virginia Woolf employs ellipsis to convey the unease at the Ramsay dinner table: “Why don’t some of you take up botany?.. With all those legs and arms why doesn’t one of you . . .?” So they would talk as usual, laughing, among the children. ”

In addition, Woolf uses a different form of ellipsis in the second chapter of the novel, “Time Passes”. Here, she uses parenthetical insertions [in square parenthesis] to denote a passing of time – 10 years – and significant events and interrupt the narrative in each section. For example, in section 6 Woolf represents both Prue Ramsay’s marriage and subsequent death in two parenthetical remarks that bookend a description of summer: “[Prue Ramsay, leaning on her father’s arm, was given in marriage. What, people said, could have been more fitting? And, they added, how beautiful she looked!]” and then, “[Prue Ramsay died that summer in some illness connected with childbirth, which was indeed a tragedy, people said, everything, they said, had promised so well.]”
