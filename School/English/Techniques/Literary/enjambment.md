A poetic technique, when a sentence or phrase runs over more than one line (or stanza). Enjambment is an interesting technique. Visually, this gives the sense that the poem flows between lines. However, in utterance, enjambment leads to a pause between lines when spoken aloud. This effect is known as a **Rejet**. Composers often use this to disrupt the flow or a poem or contrast distinct images or ideas.

In The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock by TS Eliot, the persona states:  
“Let us go then, you and I,  
When the evening is spread out against the sky  
Like a patient etherized upon a table;”

This use of enjambment conveys a romantic image of a night sky only to contrast it with the macabre image of an unconscious patient about to undergo surgery. This is jarring contrast further emphasized by the rejet.
