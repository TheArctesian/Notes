[[ambiguity]]
This refers to the use of words or expressions that are considered deictic – meaning they require on the context of other words to develop clear meaning. the most common examples of this are “me” or “here.” These words require us to know, or at least assume we know, contextual information to develop meaning.

For example, in the sentence, “I talk about writing from here.” You, the reader, will assume that “I” am a teacher at Matrix and that by “here” I mean that I am writing from or at one of the Matrix campuses.

Composers can manipulate and disorientate their readers by disrupting deixis in their texts.

TS Eliot utilises deixis extensively in ‘The Hollow Men.’ He refers to an unknown “I” and “we” and numerous places connoted as “here” to disorientate the reader.
