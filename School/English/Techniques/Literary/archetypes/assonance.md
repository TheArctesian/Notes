Assonance occurs when similar vowel sounds appear close together. This repetition can occur anywhere in the word, not only at the start.

An example of assonance is ‘she sells sea shells by sea shore.’ Like alliteration, assonance can contribute particular meanings or effects, but is often simply an organising feature.

Again, use with caution!
