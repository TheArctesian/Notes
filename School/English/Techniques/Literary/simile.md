[Similes function in the same way as metaphors](https://www.matrix.edu.au/literary-techniques-simile/), but rather than identifying the tenor and vehicle, tend to make the comparison using ‘like’ or ‘as,’ while metaphors tend to use a form of the verb ‘to be.’

King Hamlet uses simile to emphasise his sufferings in hell, declaring to Hamlet that the details of his tortures would:  
“Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;  
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,  
And each particular hair to stand on end  
Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.”
