The repetition of soft consonant sounds, such as “s” sounds. This is often used to create a sinister or sensuous tone or mood.

For example, in John Keats’ ‘Hyperion’ he develops a sinister mood through sibilance in the description, “Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge Stubborn’d with iron.”
