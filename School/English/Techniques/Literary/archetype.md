Archetypes refer to a recurring symbol, motif or character. In other terms, it is a pattern of an idea. This can refer to both archetypal characters and situations.

Archetype has two definitions, one refers to the term in general, the other to psychoanalysis. Here are the [Merriam-Webster dictionary definitions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/archetype):

1.  The original pattern or model of which all things of the same type are representations or copies
2.  psychology: an inherited idea or mode of thought in the psychology of C. G. Jung that is derived from the experience of the race and is present in the unconscious of the individual.

Character archetypes are characters you see recurring throughout different literary texts. They share similar narrative roles, characteristics, and behaviours.


### What’s the difference between a character archetype and a stock character?

You might think archetypes are similar to stock characters, but **they are not the same!**

Both character archetypes and stock characters are recognisable characters that reoccur in literary texts. However, stock characters are flat and predictable; they are often written without much thought because they are exactly the same in every text.
