A statement or aspect of a text that lacks a clear or singular meaning. Ambiguity in literary texts falls into four categories:

-   Syntactic ambiguity – Ambiguous statements that may have multiple meanings due to the punctuation of the sentence
	I rode a white horse in pink pyjamas.
		1.  The persona was wearing pink pyjamas when they rode the horse, or
		2.  The horse was wearing the pink pyjamas?
-   Semantic ambiguity – Ambiguous statements that could have multiple meanings because of the choice of words
	- Haste me to know ‘t, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.
		- As you can see, the phrase ‘as swift as meditation’ is a simile! However, the meaning of this simile is ambiguous.
		- A, now rare, meaning for the word ‘meditation’ that was used in Shakespeare’s time is ‘thought’. So, one way of interpreting what Hamlet is saying here is that his revenge will be as fast as thought.

-   Narrative ambiguity – Ambiguity surrounding the plot or characters and their motives
-   Conceptual ambiguity – Ambiguity about the concepts, themes, or ideas in the text.

Ambiguity is a higher order technique that can develop tension and uncertainty throughout. It is a technique you must know.
