Present, past, future (events are predicted). This is an important and commonplace feature of grammar that students should be familiar. Tense is an important aspect of narrative form and can tell the audience when things are occurring.

T.S Eliot’s ‘Preludes’ is written in the present continuous tense in sections I and II but then is written in the past tense in sections III and IV.
