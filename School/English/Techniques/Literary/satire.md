[Composition which ridicules in a scornful & humorous way](https://www.matrix.edu.au/literary-techniques-satire/). In satire, common human behaviours, beliefs, and vices are held up to shame and scorn. Satire is often considered a high form of comedy. Satire is often employed for biting social or political commentary. Queen Elizabeth I banned satire in  1599 to curb criticism of her reign in print.

Satire is often a part of Shakespeare’s plays, such as in the historical play, Henry IV, Part 1. Many critics argue that the character of Falstaff is a satirical representation of Sir John Oldcastle, a Lollard (the pre-cursor to protestants) who was executed for treason and heresy. Falstaff’s character was originally called, John Oldcastle, but complaints by a prominent Lord, William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham, forced Shakespeare to rename him.
