A Wireless Local Area Network is a less secure, more convenient LAN. The introduction of wireless routers allows the possibility of people physically close to the building to access the network, even if they are not part of the organization, hence the possible security threat. However, WLAN doesnâ€™t require users to connect with a cable and can instead log in using local wi-fi(which has slower speeds than ethernet cables).
