Peer 2 Peer (P2P) networks donâ€™t use typical client-server architecture. Instead each computer is a node in a network and nodes share information as requested from other nodes. Since there is no central server these networks are more reliable as all computers on the network would have to be unavailable for the network to not be operational. This also makes all resources more widely available and supports easy back-up of files as one node can take over if another fails.
