Link [[Relationships between objects]] understanding UML
**private –** this causes the property or method to not be accessible outside of the class. Only the code in the class can call those properties and methods. In UML we use a – sign next to a property or method.

**static –** this makes it so that we don’t need an object to be able to call a method or property from a class. These can be seen as underlined properties or methods within a UML diagram.

**public –** we can call the properties and methods from outside of the class. In UML we use a + sign next to a property or method.

**final –** once we set the value for this variable, we can’t change it in the future. You can find final variables in ALLCAPS and underlined in UML.

**void –** this lets us know that a method is not meant to return anything, it will do some action only.

**new –** this creates a new object from a Class.
