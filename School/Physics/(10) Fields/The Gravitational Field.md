[[Newtons Laws]]
Every mass, M, exerts an attractive force of gravity on every other mass, m, along a line joining their centers. 

The force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers

$$
F = G\frac{Mm}{r^2}
$$
Where 
$$

G = gravitational \; constant \approx 6.67 \times 10^{-11}Nm^2kg^{-2}
$$
M and M are the two masses in kg 
R = distance between the centers

For fields we remove the additional M and imagine there is a field surrounding M. IF another Mass is present then it experiences and attractive force. *Such that each point in the field has a vector quantity called the gravitational field strength vector, with a magnitude equal to the gravitational force per mass at the point and a direction equal to that of the gravitational force experienced*  

$$ \vec{g} = \frac{force \; on \; mass\; at\; point}{mass \; at\;point} = \frac{G\frac{Mm}{r^2}}{m} = G\frac{M}{r^2}$$
